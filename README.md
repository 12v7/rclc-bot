# rclc-bot
A telegram calculator bot.
The bot uses the [teloxide](https://github.com/teloxide) bot framework and the [rclc](https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/rclc_lib) mathematical library.

If you would like to host your own bot, register your bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and put the token in the [main.rs](https://github.com/12v7/rclc-bot/blob/main/src/main.rs) file.

A ready-to-use bot is also available at [rclc_bot](https://t.me/rclc_bot).
